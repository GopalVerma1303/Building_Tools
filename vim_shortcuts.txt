#keyboard macros You can start recording your keys with ESC followed by qh. Then whatever you type in vim (including commands) will be recorded. Press ESC q to stop recording. Now press @h to replay your key strokes.

#repeat action if you want to repeat an action, just type a number followed by the action. To delete 10 lines press 10dd. To press 50 lines type 50dd. You can do this for keyboard recording too, 50@h.

#run commands you can run commands right from within vim. !ls runs the command ls in your terminal. You can do this for any command.

#scrolling you can scroll inside vim with the keys ctrl+e and ctrl+y, no need to use the mouse

#move to end/begin you can use the keys 0 and $ to move to the beginning and end of a line. No need to hold down the cursor key for several seconds.

#jump to line press the keys 140G to jump to line 140. You can also use :140 if you prefer those keys.
